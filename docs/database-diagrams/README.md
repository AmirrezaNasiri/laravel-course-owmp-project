# Database Diagrams

This directory contains entities and their relations.
> Note: This is a temporary diagram for getting started. Live diagrams of the real database schema will be more useful later.

## About

## Getting Started
1. Bring-up a DBML renderer - such as [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/)
1. Paste the code and view the rendered diagram.
